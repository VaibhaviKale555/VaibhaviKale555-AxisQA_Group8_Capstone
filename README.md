This project comprises multiple capstone modules covering test automation, scenario documentation, and database scripting for different applications (e.g., IRCTC, Indigo). The project is organized into folders based on each application, containing test case documents, automation scripts, and SQL scripts. Each module folder has detailed documentation on test cases and scenarios.

Project Structure
1. Automation_Capstone
Testautomationpractice_CapstoneProject.java: Java file for a test automation project, potentially using Selenium or another testing framework. This file likely contains test scripts for automated testing of a sample or practice application.

2. Indigo_Capstone
Indigo_TestCases_Capstone.xlsx: Excel file documenting test cases for an Indigo application. Contains details on individual test cases, including expected results, steps, and inputs.
TestSecnarios_indigo.docx: Word document outlining test scenarios for the Indigo application, likely a higher-level document than the test cases.

3. IRCTC_Capstone
IRCTC_Test_Cases_Login.xlsx: Excel file containing login-related test cases for the IRCTC (Indian Railways) application.
IRCTC_Test_Scenarios.docx: Word document summarizing test scenarios specific to the IRCTC login functionality.

4. SQL_Capstone
SQL_Capstone.sql: SQL file with database queries, which may include data setup, retrieval, or testing SQL statements for application validation.
